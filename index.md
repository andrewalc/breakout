## Breakout Post Mortem
The main system I would like is an event system so that we could have objects fire off and listen for events. This would provide for cleaner interactions between classes and allow for more flexibility in functionality. This would eliminate manipulation of the paddle and ball in awkward spots.

Dedicated menu and input systems would also allow for customizable controls and simpler game flow logic when navigating between game states. In the same vein, allowing for menu selection or control with the mouse would have been useful rather than relying on keyboard input.

The last major update that would be fun is different types of blocks and more interaction between the paddle. Adding more physics interaction between the paddle and the ball would allow for a higher skill ceiling and more engaging gameplay. Adding in different types of blocks that have different effects like inverted collision effects, score modifiers, or ball power ups would add a lot to the gameplay.
